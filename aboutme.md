Iâ€™ve been married for 4 years and we have 2 kids. My passion for coding, nurtured since high school, has grown into a solid foundation of expertise in business and technology, spanning over a decade and encompassing a wide range of skills and experiences (including Apex, Visualforce, Aura components, LWC, SFDX, Git, Github Actions, Bash, Bitbucket, Bamboo, Azure DevOps, GitLab, PMD, SOAP, REST, HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, ANTLR, and Python).

In 2020, I embarked on a fulfilling journey with Booz Allen Hamilton, where I've made significant contributions to projects for the US Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs. My role as a Technical Architect has been marked by establishing architecture guidance, developing innovative solutions, and championing DevOps automation.
